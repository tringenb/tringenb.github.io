title: Guarding Users Against Risk and Deception (GUARD) Research Group
description: The GUARD (Guarding Users Against Risk and Deception) Research Group at Purdue University studies the human side of cybersecurity, with a focus on social cybersecurity—how people interact, influence, and sometimes deceive each other online. Our projects range from investigating online child safety and fraud, to understanding vigilante justice, to creating better ways to teach and learn about cybersecurity.

Students in GUARD—Ph.D., master’s, and undergraduate—work on a wide variety of projects about people and their use of technology. Some dig into persuasion and manipulation tactics used in cybercrime, while others create and deliver training for law enforcement or run hands-on workshops for teens.

If you’re interested in possibly joining GUARD, check out my page for prospective students—we’re always looking for curious, motivated people who want to explore how humans shape (and are shaped by) the digital world.
