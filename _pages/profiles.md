title: Research Group
description: The GUARD (Guarding Users Against Risk and Deception) Research Group at Purdue University studies the human side of cybersecurity, with a focus on social cybersecurity. Our projects range from investigating online child safety and fraud, to understanding vigilante justice, to creating better ways to teach and learn about cybersecurity. We work on a wide variety of projects related to people and their use of technology. Some dig into persuasion and manipulation tactics used in cybercrime, while others create and deliver training for law enforcement or run hands-on workshops for teens. **If youâ€™re interested in joining GUARD, check out our page for prospective students.**
